# ArgoCD for Janus IDP

This repo contains build instructions to fetch code from https://github.com/RoadieHQ/roadie-backstage-plugins/, exclude everything but the ArgoCD plugins/packages, and configure them so they're buildable separately.

This repo will also feed the build processes for Red Hat Plug-ins for Backstage.
